# 📏 Font Size Update - 24px

## ✅ **UPDATE COMPLETE**

I've increased the meditation text font size to **24px** and adjusted the layout to prevent any text clipping.

---

## 📊 **Font Size Changes**

### **Before:**
- Meditation Text: **18px**
- Line Height: 1.7
- 6-line clipping restriction

### **After:**
- Meditation Text: **24px** (+33% larger!)
- Line Height: 1.6 (optimized for readability)
- No clipping - text flows naturally
- Content area scrollable if needed

### **Responsive Sizes:**
- **Small phones (<375px):** 22px
- **iPhone 13 Pro Max:** 24px
- **Tablets/Desktop (>768px):** 26px

---

## 🎨 **Layout Adjustments**

### **1. Text Container**
- Increased bottom margin: 30px → 40px
- No line clipping restrictions
- Full text always visible

### **2. Image Container**
- Width adjusted: 70% → 65%
- Max-width: 400px → 380px
- Added bottom margin for spacing
- Lighter shadow for white theme

### **3. Content Area**
- Already scrollable (`overflow-y: auto`)
- Smooth scrolling on iOS (`-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`)
- Text never gets cut off - can scroll if needed

### **4. Image Shadow**
- Updated for white theme: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)` (lighter)
- Previously: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)` (too dark for white bg)

## ✅ **What This Solves**

### **Before (Issues):**
❌ Text could get clipped with 6-line restriction  
❌ 18px might be small for some users  
❌ Shadow too dark for white background  
❌ Fixed line-clamp could cut sentences  

### **After (Fixed):**
✅ **24px is easy to read** - No squinting needed  
✅ **No text clipping** - Full meditation always visible  
✅ **Scrollable if needed** - Long meditations won't overflow  
✅ **Better spacing** - More breathing room  
✅ **Responsive** - Adjusts for all screen sizes  
✅ **Softer shadow** - Appropriate for white theme
