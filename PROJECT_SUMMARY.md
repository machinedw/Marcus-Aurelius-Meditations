## 📖 **Sample Meditation**

```
Book 2: Morning Resolve • Meditation 1 of 17
[███░░░░░░░░░] 6%

When you wake, tell yourself: today I'll meet 
interference, ingratitude, arrogance, disloyalty. 
They act from ignorance of good and evil. I know 
better. I won't be harmed by their confusion. 
I choose my response.

## 🙏 **Philosophy Behind the Build**

This app embodies Stoic principles in its design:

- **Simplicity** - No unnecessary features
- **Utility** - Every element serves a purpose
- **Resilience** - Works offline, no dependencies
- **Privacy** - No tracking or data collection
- **Timelessness** - Classic design that won't age
- **Accessibility** - Available to anyone with a device
- **Focus** - One meditation, one moment, one insight

Marcus Aurelius wrote his meditations for himself, never intending publication. This app honors that spirit: a private tool for personal growth.
